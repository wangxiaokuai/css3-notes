#animation相关的（10）
### @keyframes
定义关键帧和动画
The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.
The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.
During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.
Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.
Tip: For best browser support, you should always define both the 0% and the 100% selectors.
Note: Use the animation properties to control the appearance of the animation, and also to bind the animation to selectors.用animation属性，将动画绑定到选择器。

#### Values（3）:
```
@keyframes animationname {keyframes-selector {css-styles;}}
```
##### animationname
Required. Defines the name of the animation.
##### keyframes-selector
Percentage of the animation duration.Note: You can have many keyframes-selectors in one animation.

* 0-100%  
* from (same as 0%)
* to (same as 100%)
##### css-styles
Required. One or more legal CSS style properties


### animation
* 为元素添加自动播放的动画——播放完元素会回归初始位置。
* 并控制动画的播放
* 动画由@keyframes定义，谢谢~


Usage:
```
div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background: red;
    position: relative;
    animation: mymove 5s infinite;
}


@keyframes mymove {
    from {left: 0px;}
    to {left: 200px;}
}
```


The animation property is a shorthand property for eight of the animation properties（8）:
* animation-name
* animation-duration **（required）**
* animation-timing-function
* animation-delay
* animation-iteration-count
* animation-direction
* animation-fill-mode
* animation-play-state
Note: Always specify the animation-duration property, otherwise the duration is 0, and will never be played.


Default value: none 0 ease 0 1 normal none running
Inherited: no


#### 跟transition的区别
播放的触发条件不一样


### animation-name
The animation-name property specifies a name for the @keyframes animation.


### animation-duration
The animation-duration property defines how many seconds or milliseconds an animation takes to complete one cycle.


### animation-timing-function
The animation-timing-function specifies the speed curve of an animation.
The speed curve defines the TIME an animation uses to change from one set of CSS styles to another.
The speed curve is used to make the changes smoothly.
Values:
（参见transition属性）


### animation-delay
第一次播放动画之前的延时
The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.
The animation-delay value is defined in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).


### animation-iteration-count
动画播放次数。
The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should be played.


Default value: 1


Values:
Value |Description
---|:---
number |A number that defines how many times an animation should be played. Default value is 1 Play it »
infinite |Specifies that the animation should be played infinite times (for ever)




### animation-direction
关键帧动画的播放方向——时间轴上的方向
The animation-direction property defines whether an animation should play in reverse direction or in alternate cycles.


Default value: normal
Inherited: no


Values:
Value |Description
---|:---
normal |顺时间播放。Default value. The animation should be played as normal
reverse |反过来播放。The animation should play in reverse direction
alternate |顺一次，反一次。The animation will be played as normal every odd time (1,3,5,etc..) and in reverse direction every even time (2,4,6,etc...)
alternate-reverse |反一次，顺一次。The animation will be played in reverse direction every odd time (1,3,5,etc..) and in a normal direction every even time (2,4,6,etc...)
Note: The "reverse" and "alternate-reverse" values are not supported in Safari.




### animation-fill-mode
The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (when it is finished, or when it has a delay).


By default, CSS animations do not affect the element until the first keyframe is "played", and then stops once the last keyframe has completed. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.
Default value: none
Inherited: no


Values:
Value |Description
---|:---
none |元素将回到播放动画前的状态。Default value. The animation will not apply any styles to the target element before or after it is executing
forwards |元素将留在播放动画最后一帧。After the animation ends (determined by animation-iteration-count), the animation will apply the property values for the time the animation ended
backwards |（看不明白。。）The animation will apply the property values defined in the keyframe that will start the first iteration of the animation, during the period defined by animation-delay. These are either the values of the from keyframe (when animation-direction is "normal" or "alternate") or those of the to keyframe (when animation-direction is "reverse" or "alternate-reverse")
both |（更不明白。。）The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards. That is, it will extend the animation properties in both directions


### animation-play-state
动画的播放状态——可以用脚本控制。
The animation-play-state property specifies whether the animation is running or paused.
Note: Use this property in a JavaScript to pause an animation in the middle of a cycle.


Default value: running
Inherited: no


Values:
```
animation-play-state: paused|running;
```
