Absolute Lengths

The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
Unit Description
 cm centimeters Try it
 mm millimeters Try it
 in inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) Try it
 px * pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in) Try it
 pt points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in) Try it
 pc picas (1pc = 12 pt) Try it


* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.
